Analyzing finances of healthcare for different countries

Health is an essential aspect of every country’s overall well-being. The general health of its population and their access to healthcare is an especially important way of determining the country’ responsibilities towards its people. Even though in some countries, access to healthcare is considered a basic right, this varies from country to country based on numerous factors. It is availed by people in many ways, which can be either public, private, or personal.  

In layman terms, public healthcare is a scenario where the costs of the treatment are covered by the government, Private healthcare is a scenario where costs are covered under insurance through various companies and policies, and Personal is when the patient covers the cost of treatment through his own pocket.  

When we discuss the difference in how much each country spends on healthcare, we find a unique combination of two different yet closely related aspects: Health and Finance. It was this specific combination that inspired us to understand more and investigate the distinct aspects of this domain in detail. On finding a dataset that perfectly matched our needs, we started working on it. In this project, we discuss the difference in expenditure of Developed and Developing countries and take several parameters to identify why there is a difference and how we can minimize it. Moreover, we discuss how an unprecedented event like COVID affects financial healthcare. 

For the scope of this project, we will be using the criteria's given by the United Nations to classify countries into categories of Developed and Developing, and we will be considering 10 of each to clearly understand and prevent any wrong analysis due to lack of data.

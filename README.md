## Introduction

Health is an essential aspect of every country’s overall well-being. The general health of its population and their access to healthcare is an especially important way of determining the country’ responsibilities towards its people. Even though in some countries, access to healthcare is considered a basic right, this varies from country to country based on numerous factors. It is availed by people in many ways, which can be either public, private, or personal.  

In layman terms, public healthcare is a scenario where the costs of the treatment are covered by the government, Private healthcare is a scenario where costs are covered under insurance through various companies and policies, and Personal is when the patient covers the cost of treatment through his own pocket.  

When we discuss the difference in how much each country spends on healthcare, we find a unique combination of two different yet closely related aspects: Health and Finance. It was this specific combination that inspired us to understand more and investigate the distinct aspects of this domain in detail. On finding a dataset that perfectly matched our needs, we started working on it. In this project, we discuss the difference in expenditure of Developed and Developing countries and take several parameters to identify why there is a difference and how we can minimize it. Moreover, we discuss how an unprecedented event like COVID affects financial healthcare. 

For the scope of this project, we will be using the criteria's given by the United Nations to classify countries into categories of Developed and Developing, and we will be considering 10 of each to clearly understand and prevent any wrong analysis due to lack of data.  

## Conclusion

When we take a look at the overall conclusions of our project, we come to realize that Developed
countries spend more on healthcare than the developing countries, and this trend seems to go upwards
I.e., the expenditure in the health sector seems to be increasing. Due to this, the out-of-pocket
expenditure of the populations of developing countries is much higher than that of developed countries.
When observing the government expenditure vs private expenditure for each country, governments
seem to be catching up with the private firms, but however they are still far behind. With an increase in
government expenditure in developing countries, we can see that the out-of-pocket costs show a
declining trend. However, for it to be comparable with the developed countries, the government
expenditures will have to match that of the developed countries.
When we look at the visualization for external healthcare assistance received by each developing
country, we understand that South Africa receives the most aid and all other countries rec eive
approximately the same amount. This can be correlated with their population and also individual
expenditure on health to understand the importance of the aid being sent to them. We also come to
understand that the more expenditure in healthcare sector, longer is the life expectancy. This might be
related to the reduced out-of-pocket expenditure of the developed countries.
When talking about the increase in healthcare expenditure during the pandemic, we observe that there
was about 2% increase in expenditures of developed countries, while only 1% increase in expenditures
of developing countries. This can be correlated with the aid received by developing countries during
the pandemic, due to which developed countries ended up spending more. Furthermore, we saw how
much help a country received from other countries during the pandemic. Plotting a mix of developed
and developing countries, we find that even with a strong healthcare expenditure they needed help from
other countries to navigate through the tough times as observed by the examples of United Kingdom
and Netherlands.
